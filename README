Running locally from source build
--------

To run the game from the build directory, you need to point to the game data
folder. The game data folder is set by the environment variable SKDATA. In
a bash shell, this can be accomplished by (a quick demo launch)
$ LD_LIBRARY_PATH=build/install/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu \
SKDATA=build/install/7kaa/data \
build/install/bin/7kaa -demo
